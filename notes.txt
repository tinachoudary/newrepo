jdbc driver- we are using type 4 
type 4 driver written in java- platform independent
read about this.

crreat proj
add jdbc jar to proj
create driver name -load driver
even without loading u can directly cnonnnect after jdbc 4.0 version
create conn to driver
u need statement to fire the query.
prepapred statement ane option kuda undito fire query
statemt nt dont use. when we use query multiple time in program with just diff params, it will still compile every time.
so use prepare statement
by default queries are autocommited
a transaction is with respect to a connection, not table
within the boundary whatever u do will be permanent when u commit
within the boundary if some error comes when we update or delete or smthng, error -> goes to catch -> so in catch put rollback
transaction isolated level - read abt it
transaction isolation level by default is read commited. ante read only committed record. but u can change also. con.setTransactionIsolation(); -> but not recommended to change
connection pool available 1. dbcp 2.c3p0 3.hikari







1.make packages layers
2. find models- is a relationship
   2 types of loans, types of cars ala. Make 1 abstract and 2 concrete clsses then.
    u can make record instead of class. but u cant have 2 types apudu. andddd, u can have one obj as a field in another. like author in book.
3. Make interface in storage. HAve the CRUD operations
4. in constructor of storageimpl add atleast 1 or 2 models already so that smthg is there in a collection when obj of storageimpl creted

Object creation is complex
spring framework, ioc,di

IOC - C ANTE CREATE AND DESTROY
ORDER CLIENT HAS CONTROL ON ORDER SERVICE BECAUSE IT HAS THE POWER TO CREATE AN OBJECT OF OBJECT SERVICE
This is wrong
Solution is I in IOC- INVERSE.

Inversion of Control

means delegate the object creatin job to someone else. 

spring - by default singleton for any obj 
if u want you can get diff objs scope ="prototype"
if service doesn't have state- singleton.
otherwise - prototype
with spring contrxt dependency - ioc and di alone can be done
configuring beans - wiring antaru

Request Mappings
URI Patterns,HTTP Methods, Request parameters
oka http req lo ila- https:// localhost/ portfolio unte
first it ll go to front controller. it ll hcekc, oh portfolio undhi ani. it ll pass i tto a controller which has request mapping /portfolio.
If method not mentioned, default mapping for requestmapping is GET.
REST- Architectural pattern for web sefvices, uses HTTP Spectification

spring.sql.init.mode=always----always initialize database when app is bootstrapped
logging.level.web=trace
#above helps to see mapping of controller

Hibernate is a ORM tool
ORM- Object Relational Mapping
JPA gives the annotations(interfaces). Hibernate/orm will implement it.

react
node js- runtime for js
js runtime normally provided by browser. to run outside browser, js is used

Js lo type is dynamically store. thats why ppl use typescript to maintain safety.
var tho declare chesthe, we get global scope. let tho block scope.
const values cant be changed

index.js is entry pt in react project.
react comes with a dev server


when html file created, browser that has a dom  creates a dom and shows that on web.
when we create react file, renders to react dom(virtual dom), it sends to browser dom, 
react dom thorugh enhuku why not direct ga ante beacus of performance. normally when there is a change in dom tree, entire tree is refereshed. but incase of react , only th epart that is changed is refereshed.
react anni componnets la chstuhadhi. like login componetnt etc.

html tags arent case sensitive. but in react, all html tags shld be in lowercase.

every coomp has 2 compartments- view and model.{} binds model to view.
// u shld have closing tag compulory. otherwise error in react

state management
In react, jsx is converted to pure js and sent to js.

Soucr obj-> generates events-> evet handlers


By default, view will not react to model. to make it react, we shld use useState() to make it change the value in view as well.
